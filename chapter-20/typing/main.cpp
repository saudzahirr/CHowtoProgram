NOTE:
    One way to determine the type of an object is to use a switch statement
    to check the value of a field in the object. This allows us to distinguish
    among object types, then invoke an appropriate action for a particular object.
    For example, in a hierarchy of shapes in which each shape object has a shapeType
    attribute, a switch statement could check the objectâ€™s shapeType to determine
    which print function to call.

    Using switch logic exposes programs to a variety of potential problems. For example,
    you might forget to include a type test when one is warranted, or might forget to
    test all possible cases in a switch statement. When modifying a switch-based system
    by adding new types, you might forget to insert the new cases in all relevant switch
    statements. Every addition or deletion of a class requires the modification of every
    switch statement in the system; tracking these statements down can be time consuming
    and error prone.
