/*
NOTE:
    C++ disallows member function calls for const objects unless
    the member functions themselves are also declared const. This
    is true even for get member functions that do not modify the
    object.

    A constructor must be allowed to modify an object so that the
    object can be initialized properly. A destructor must be able to
    perform its termination housekeeping chores before an objectâ€™s
    memory is reclaimed by the system. Attempting to declare a
    constructor or destructor const is a compilation error.
