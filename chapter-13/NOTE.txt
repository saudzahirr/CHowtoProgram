The C preprocessor executes before a program is compiled.
Some actions it performs are:
    1. the inclusion of other files into the file being compiled,
    2. definition of symbolic constants and macros,
    3. conditional compilation of program code and
    4. conditional execution of preprocessor directives.

Preprocessor directives begin with #, and only whitespace characters
and comments delimited by /* and */ may appear before a preprocessor
directive on a line. C has perhaps the largest installed base of
“legacy code” of any modern programming language. It’s been in active
use for more than four decades. As a professional C programmer, you’re
likely to encounter code written many years ago using older programming
techniques.
