/*
NOTE:
    The Standard C's assert macro tests the value of an
    expression at execution time. If the conditionâ€™s value
    is false, assert prints an error message and calls function
    abort to terminate the program. This is useful for debugging
    purposes. C11 now provides _Static_assert for compile-time
    assertions that test constant expressions after the
    preprocessor executes and at a point during compilation
    when the types of expressions are known. For more details
    see Section 6.7.10 of the C11 standard document.
