/*
NOTE:
    Often itâ€™s necessary to skip certain characters in the input stream.
    For this reason, scanf provides the assignment suppression character *.
    This character enables scanf to read any type of data from the input
    and discard it without assigning it to a variable. The assignment
    suppression character used in the %c conversion specifier indicates that
    a character appearing in the input stream should be read and discarded.
