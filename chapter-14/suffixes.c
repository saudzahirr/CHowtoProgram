/*
NOTE:
    C provides integer and floating-point suffixes for
    explicitly specifying the data types of integer and
    floating-point literal values. (The C standard refers
    to such literal values as constants). If an integer
    literal is not suffixed, its type is determined by the
    first type capable of storing a value of that size (first
    int, then long int, then unsigned long int, etc.). A
    floating-point literal thatâ€™s not suffixed is automatically
    of type double.

    The integer suffixes are: u or U for an unsigned int, l
    or L for a long int, and ll or LL for a long long int.
    You can combine u or U with those for long int and long
    long int to create unsigned literals for the larger integer
    types.
