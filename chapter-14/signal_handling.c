/*
NOTE:
    An external asynchronous event, or signal, can cause
    a program to terminate prematurely. Some events include
    interrupts (typing <Ctrl> c on a Linux/UNIX or Windows
    system or <command> c on OS X) and termination orders from
    the operating system. The signal-handling library (<signal.h>)
    provides the capability to trap unexpected events with
    function signal. Function signal receives two argumentsâ€”an
    integer signal number and a pointer to the signal-handling
    function. Signals can be generated by function raise, which
    takes an integer signal number as an argument. function raise
    is used to simulate a signals.

    SIGABRT
        Abnormal termination of the program (such as a call to function abort).
    
    SIGFPE
        An erroneous arithmetic operation, such as a divide-by-zero or an
        operation resulting in overflow.

    SIGILL
        Detection of an illegal instruction.

    SIGINT
        Receipt of an interactive attention signal (<Ctrl> c or <command> c).

    SIGSEGV
        An attempt to access memory that is not allocated to a program.

    SIGTERM
        A termination request sent to the program.
