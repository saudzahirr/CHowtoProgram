/*
NOTE:
    Computers represent all data internally as sequences of bits.
    Each bit can assume the value 0 or the value 1. On most systems,
    a sequence of eight bits forms a byteâ€”the typical storage unit for
    a variable of type char. Other data types are stored in larger
    numbers of bytes. The bitwise operators are used to manipulate the
    bits of integral operands, both signed and unsigned. Unsigned integers
    are normally used with the bitwise operators.

    Bitwise data manipulations are machine dependent.
